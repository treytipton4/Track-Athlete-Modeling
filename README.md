# Track-Athlete-Modeling

In this project we looked at data from Wayde Van Niekerk's 400m events over the course of his career. The data includes weather from the event, whether it was a ceritified track, whether it was indoor or outdoor, what type of event it was (Olympic, World's, etc.), and of course his 400 meter dash times. Our goal was to create a model to predict Wayde's time based on the environment of the event; we hope that this model gives us insight into how fast Wayde, and likely other runners as well, runs depending on the characteristics surrounding the event.

We created several graphs for exploratory data analysis and then created several different types of models (decision tree, gradient boost, linear) and compared them.

Here is the [pdf](Track-Athlete-Modeling.pdf) of the project with everything included.

We created this using RStudio.
